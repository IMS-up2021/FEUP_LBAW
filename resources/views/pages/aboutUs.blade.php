<div class = "aboutUs">
    <p> BrainShare is an innovative web-based information system, designed for everyone who wants to exchange knowledge through collaborative questions and answers in a structured manner, through the use of tags to separate information into categories. </p> 

    <p> The goal behind the project is to foster personal growth in the user by allowing them to engage in discussion on themes that are relevant to their own interests. </p>

    <p> We are motivated by the personal growth of our users. We believe that through collaboration our users can develop their own knowledge and that of others at a rate higher than otherwise and thus we seek to develop a platform to make this possible.
        application enables users to organize and track all their questions and answers; they may be scattered across various topics, and the system will centralize them into a virtual knowledge hub accessible to all users. </p>
