### 3. Application Help

> The Help-related features have been integrated alongside the other main functionalities. They are manifested through the implementation of "403 pages" when an action lacks authorization, as well as through error/success messages that accompany specific actions. Additionally, these features are also incorporated into static pages such as  "FAQ", "About us" and "Contacts". Here are some examples:

> FAQ page

> About us page

> Contacts page

> Login error message

> Delete user success message

### 4. Input Validation

> For the back-end input validation, we used the versatile "validate" function from the Illuminate\Http\Request. This function was systematically applied across various controller functions in our project, covering a range of validation types (excluding the GET method).
- Edit profile example:

![edit_profile_code](uploads/1658b2cb2b67b0eb1455ec67b103755a/image.png)

> On the other side, the client-side validation is designed to enhance the user experience. Therefore ,for example, when editing a comment, if a user attempts to submit an empty comment, a warning is triggered.
